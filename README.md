# Cairo VM in Typescript

## What is Cairo

<!-- TODO: fill this section -->

Cairo stands for CPU AIR "o" (like insp"o", conv"o", ðŸ¤”). See
[Cairo whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063) for more information.

## Why this

There are currently three Cairo VM implementations:

- the original
  [python implementation](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang) by
  Starkware (prod)
- the new [rust implementation](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm) by
  Lambda Class (prod)
- a new [go implementation](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm_in_go) by
  Lambda Class (dev)

<!-- TODO: add some context about the need of client diversity -->

The Go implementation comes with an
[impressive documentation](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm_in_go/blob/main/README.md#documentation)
regarding the how-to for a Cairo VM. This repo is coded with the flow while
reading it.

This class is intricately involved in the processing of each instruction, from decoding the bytecode to executing the corresponding operations. It adeptly manages the interplay between memory, computation, and state transitions.

- **Functions**:
    - `fn_step`: This function acts as the heartbeat of the VirtualMachine, propelling the execution process forward. It retrieves the next encoded instruction from memory, decodes it, and then proceeds to run the instruction. The function embodies the cycle of fetch-decode-execute, pivotal in the VM's operation, and ensures that the VM advances through the program correctly.

    - `fn_runInstruction`: Central to the VM's instruction processing, this function takes a decoded instruction and orchestrates its execution. It computes the operands, performs any necessary assertions (especially for assert and call opcodes), updates the VM's registers, and progresses the VM's step count. This function is where the VM's instruction logic comes to life, translating the decoded instructions into concrete actions.

    - `fn_computeOperands`: As the VM's computational strategist, this function computes the operands required for the current instruction. It handles the intricacies of fetching operand values from memory or deducing them based on the instruction's context. This includes computing addresses for operands, handling special cases for undefined operands, and ensuring all operands are ready for the execution phase.

    - `fn_updatePc, fn_updateFp, fn_updateAp`: These functions collectively maintain the VM's register state, ensuring that the program counter (PC), frame pointer (FP), and allocation pointer (AP) are updated in accordance with the executed instruction. They handle various scenarios, such as regular PC increments, jumps, conditional jumps, and updates to the FP and AP based on the instruction's logic. These updates are critical for the correct flow of program execution and memory management within the VM.
